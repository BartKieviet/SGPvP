    <h2><a name="quickstart">Quick start</a></h2>

    <p>This script adds a number of keyboard commands to help in PvP
    combat. In general, it's used as follows:</p>

    <ol>
     <li>
      <p><strong>Configure the script.</strong></p>

      <p>Press the info key, I, to bring up the configuration dialogue
      and specify which pilots are to be targeted.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Set a retreat tile.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to your retreat tile and press the key Z to have the
      script "remember" it. The retreat tile can be a planet,
      wormhole, whatever, but it has to be in sight and reachable from
      the tile where PvP will occur.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Engage.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to the tile where PvP will occur and press the engage
      key, X, repeatedly. As soon as a target appears, you will be
      taken to the combat screen. Pressing the engage key X again will
      shoot 20 rounds against the target, with missiles if
      available.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Disengage.</strong></p>

      <p>When you have to retreat, press the disengage key, C,
      repeatedly if needed, until you are back at your retreat
      tile.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

    <p>A number of other keys are defined for convenience; see below.</p>

    <h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

    <p>The script requires that you specify which ships on your tile
    are to be attacked, and which are to be excluded from attack.</p>

    <p>The way this is done is by pasting a quick list into the
    configuration dialogue. The script parses the same QL format used
    for ambushes, and learns from it which factions, alliances, and
    individuals are to be included and excluded. Note, however, that
    friend/foe, bounty, and ship class/size criteria in the QL are
    ignored.</p>

    <p>On top of the QL, the script provides for include and exclude
    override lists. You can specify only pilot names in these lists,
    not alliances or factions. Pilots excluded this way won't be
    engaged no matter what. Pilots included in this way will not only
    be engaged, but will also be prioritised: of all the ships on your
    tile, the one listed first in your include override list will be
    targeted.</p>

    <p>When no priority targets are present on the tile, then, if
    possible, the "strongest" opponent is targeted, based on ship type
    (e.g., the War Nova will be engaged rather than the Hawk). If the
    option "prioritise traders" is enabled, then this logic will
    change to target traders and less dangerous fighters first.</p>

    <p>The final criteria for picking a target is the target pilot's
    ID. All else being the same, the pilot with the lowest ID will be
    engaged.</p>

    <p>Finally, you have to specify your ship's maximum armour points
    and installed armour strength (1 through 6).  This is required for
    computing the amount of robots to use when repairing your ship.
    Note that the script will repair you to full armour even if it has
    to partially waste one robot.</p>

    <p>If you'd rather the script doesn't waste bots, manually
    configure your ship armour points to the result of:</p>

    <pre><em>max_ship_armour</em> - (180/<em>armour_strength</em>) + 1</pre>

    <p>(e.g. 445 for a Hawk with level V armour)</p>

    <h2><a name="keymap">Keymap</a></h2>

    <pre>Z - Set retreat tile.
X - Engage.
C - Disengage.
V - Nav.
B - Use as many bots as needed to repair you to full armour.

M - Engage MO or building.

A - Use up to two bots.
S - Use up to five bots.
D - Use up to eight bots.
F - Refill your fuel tank.
K - Cloak.
L - Uncloak.

I - Configure.
T - Test configuration (highlight targets without engaging)
N - Test bots (shows how many would be used to repair your ship)

Additionally, the traditional 12345 keys are bound, for ease of transition:

1 - Target.
2 - Attack.
3 - Nav.
4 - Jump to retreat tile.
5 - Use five bots.</pre>
