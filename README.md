# The Scorpion Guard's Better PvP Pardus Extension, the FWEer's best friend.

**SGPvP** is a browser extension that enhances the user interface of the online
space game [Pardus](http://www.pardus.at/). It adds keyboard shortcuts to player
vs. player combat, giving you an edge in speed while engaged in a dogfight.

* [Install SGPvP for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sgs-better-pvp-pardus-ext/fgaanejfgbdmilifodhjhlpkigncjfih)
* [Install SGPvP for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sgpvp-pardus-trader-edition/)

Once installed, reload your Pardus tab, press the key _i_ (for _info_), and find
and click the link to the online help; this will get you started.

**Firefox users: please note that the Greasemonkey version is now deprecated**, it will
not be supported or updated any more. Firefox users should remove it and install
the version from Mozilla Add-ons.

# This fork of the original extension has not yet been approved by the Pardus developers! Use at your own risk!
