    <h2><a name="quickstart">Quick start</a></h2>

    <p>This script adds a number of keyboard commands to help in PvP
    combat. In general, it's used as follows:</p>

    <ol>
     <li>
      <p><strong>Configure the script.</strong></p>

      <p>Press the <em>Configure</em> key (<span>I</span> in the
      default keymap) to bring up the configuration dialogue, and
      specify there which pilots are to be targeted, as well as your
      ship's armour and any custom key bindings you'd like.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Set a retreat tile.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to your retreat tile and press the <em>Set retreat
      tile</em> key (<span>Z</span> in the default keymap) to have the
      script "remember" it. The retreat tile can be a planet,
      wormhole, whatever, but it has to be in sight and reachable from
      the tile where PvP will occur.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Engage.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to the tile where PvP will occur and press the
      <em>Engage</em> key (<span>X</span> in the default keymap)
      repeatedly. As soon as a target appears, you will be taken to
      the combat screen. Pressing the <em>Engage</em> key again will
      fire against the target.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Disengage.</strong></p>

      <p>When you have to retreat, press the <em>Disengage</em> key
      (<span>C</span> in the default keymap) repeatedly if needed,
      until you are back at your retreat tile.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

    <p>There are many additional functions that you can use; see
    below.</p>

    <h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

    <h3>Targeting</h3>

    <p>The script requires that you specify which ships on your tile
    are to be attacked, and which are to be excluded from attack.</p>

    <p>The way this is done is by pasting a quick list into the
    configuration dialogue. The script parses the same QL format used
    for ambushes, and learns from it which factions, alliances, and
    individuals are to be included and excluded. Note, however, that
    friend/foe, bounty, and ship class/size criteria in the QL are
    ignored.</p>

    <p>On top of the QL, the script provides for include and exclude
    override lists. You can specify only pilot names or IDs in these
    lists, not alliances or factions. Pilots excluded this way won't
    be engaged no matter what. Pilots included in this way will not
    only be engaged, but will also be prioritised: of all the ships on
    your tile, the one listed first on your include override list will
    be targeted.</p>

    <p>When no priority targets are present on the tile, then a target
    is selected based on ship type &#8212; the script attempts to
    engage traders and battleships first, breakers last.  As a last
    resort, all else being the same, the pilot with the lowest ID will
    be engaged.</p>

    <h3>Keymap</h3>

    <p>In the configuration dialogue, click on <em>Key bindings</em>
    to view and edit the keymap.  You may click on any key to
    customise its behaviour.  Do note that there many available
    functions not bound to a key by default, so explore and suit
    yourself.</p>

    <p>If you remove the <em>Configure</em> key, or change its binding
    and later forget what you chose, remember that you can always
    press <span>Esc</span> to open the configuration dialogue
    again.</p>

    <h3>Robots</h3>

    <p>You have to specify your ship's maximum armour points and
    installed armour strength (1 through 6).  This is required for
    computing the amount of robots to use when repairing your ship.
    Note that the script will repair you to full armour even if it has
    to partially waste one robot.  If you'd rather the script doesn't
    waste bots, manually configure your ship armour points to the
    result of:</p>

    <pre><em>max_ship_armour</em> - (180/<em>armour_strength</em>) + 1</pre>

    <p>(e.g. 445 for a Hawk with level V armour)</p>

    <p>There are rare situations in which the script cannot ascertain
    how many robots are available, or the state of the ship's armour;
    the script will then guess, based on last known values, but it may
    get it wrong.  For such cases, you may want to define and use
    <em>Force use robots</em> keys: the script will attempt to use as
    many bots as you specify for those, regardless of what it "thinks"
    you have or are needed.</p>
