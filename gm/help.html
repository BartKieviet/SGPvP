    <h2><a name="quickstart">Quick start</a></h2>

    <p>This script adds a number of keyboard commands to help in PvP
    combat. In general, it's used as follows:</p>

    <ol>
     <li>
      <p><strong>Configure the script.</strong></p>

      <p>Press the info key, I, to bring up the configuration dialogue
      and specify which pilots are to be targeted.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Set a retreat tile.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to your retreat tile and press the key Z to have the
      script "remember" it. The retreat tile can be a planet,
      wormhole, whatever, but it has to be in sight and reachable from
      the tile where PvP will occur.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Engage.</strong></p>

      <p>Move to the tile where PvP will occur and press the engage
      key, X, repeatedly. As soon as a target appears, you will be
      taken to the combat screen. Pressing the engage key X again will
      shoot 20 rounds against the target, with missiles if
      available.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p><strong>Disengage.</strong></p>

      <p>When you have to retreat, press the disengage key, C,
      repeatedly if needed, until you are back at your retreat
      tile.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>

    <p>A number of other keys are defined for convenience; see below.</p>

    <h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>

    <h3>Targeting</h3>

    <p>The script requires that you specify which ships on your tile
    are to be attacked, and which are to be excluded from attack.</p>

    <p>The way this is done is by pasting a quick list into the
    configuration dialogue. The script parses the same QL format used
    for ambushes, and learns from it which factions, alliances, and
    individuals are to be included and excluded. Note, however, that
    friend/foe, bounty, and ship class/size criteria in the QL are
    ignored.</p>

    <p>On top of the QL, the script provides for include and exclude
    override lists. You can specify only pilot names in these lists,
    not alliances or factions. Pilots excluded this way won't be
    engaged no matter what. Pilots included in this way will not only
    be engaged, but will also be prioritised: of all the ships on your
    tile, the one listed first in your include override list will be
    targeted.</p>

    <p>When no priority targets are present on the tile, then a target
    is selected based on ship type - the script attempts to engage
    traders and battleships first, breakers last.  As a last resort,
    all else being the same, the pilot with the lowest ID will be
    engaged.</p>

    <h3>Robots</h3>

    <p>You have to specify your ship's maximum armour points and
    installed armour strength (1 through 6).  This is required for
    computing the amount of robots to use when repairing your ship.
    Note that the script will repair you to full armour even if it has
    to partially waste one robot.  If you'd rather the script doesn't
    waste bots, manually configure your ship armour points to the
    result of:</p>

    <pre><em>max_ship_armour</em> - (180/<em>armour_strength</em>) + 1</pre>

    <p>(e.g. 445 for a Hawk with level V armour)</p>

    <p>There are rare situations in which the script cannot ascertain
    how many robots are available, or the state of the ship's armour;
    the script will then guess, based on last known values, but it may
    get it wrong.  For such cases, use the specific keys for 1, 4, or
    8 robots: the script will attempt to use that many bots regardless
    of what it "thinks" you have or are needed.</p>

    <h2><a name="keymap">Keymap</a></h2>

    <pre>Z - Set retreat tile.
X - Engage.
C - Disengage.
V - Nav.
B - Use as many bots as needed to repair you to full armour.

M - Engage MO or building.

A - Force use of one bot.
S - Force use of four bots.
D - Force use of eight bots.
F - Refill your fuel tank.
K - Cloak.
L - Uncloak.
Q - Enter inner starbase ("fly close").
W - Exit inner starbase.
O - Undock.
P - Dock.

I - Configure.
T - Test configuration (highlight targets without engaging)
N - Test bots (shows how many would be used to repair your ship)

Additionally, the traditional 12345 keys are bound, for ease of transition:

1 - Target.
2 - Attack.
3 - Nav.
4 - Jump to retreat tile.
5 - Use five bots.</pre>
